# ESP8266_Base
Base software for IOT with ESP8266 using Arduino IDE (https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino)

The idea is to create a software which can be used as base for different IOT projects.

What should be in:

* Run a simple webserver to make interaction simple
* Configure the ESP with your WLAN settings (and store them in EEPROM) by creating an AP
* Connect to WLAN
